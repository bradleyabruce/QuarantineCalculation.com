      <p class="lead">Social distancing is one of the most effective things individuals can do to slow the spread of a disease due to how rapidly a population can become infected over time. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is currently responding to the first global pandemic since 1918. Governments around the world have ordered people to stay home if possible to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
      <p>This website will attempt to show you why. </p>

This type of spread grows exponentially because for every new individual that becomes infected, the rate at which infection occurs also increases.

          <h2>About Social Distancing Calculator</h2>
          <p class="lead">Quarantine Calculation uses a variety of data sources to calculate the most likely possible infection rates. Epidemology, or the study of the spread of diseases, is difficult in any situation, but even more so during an active pandemic due to a variety of factors. All results on this website are estimates based on observed data from the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China and should not be taken as scientific fact. This website's purpose is to simply show how the exponential spead of a disease can affect many people over time. </p>
